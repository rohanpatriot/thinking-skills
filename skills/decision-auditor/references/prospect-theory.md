# Prospect Theory

Prospect Theory is Kahneman and Tversky's description of how people actually make decisions under risk. It replaced expected utility theory's assumption of rational actors with a psychologically accurate model.

## Bernoulli's Error

Classical economics (from Bernoulli, 1738) assumed:
- Utility is a function of total wealth
- People are consistently risk-averse
- The same wealth produces the same happiness

**Why this is wrong - The Jack and Jill Problem:**
> Jack and Jill each have $5 million today.
> Yesterday, Jack had $1 million. Jill had $9 million.
> Are they equally happy?

Of course not. Jack is elated; Jill is miserable. Happiness depends on changes, not states. This is obvious—yet economic theory ignored it for 250 years.

**Theory-induced blindness:** Once you accept a theory and use it as a tool, you fail to notice its flaws. Counterexamples get explained away rather than taken seriously.

## The Three Core Principles

### 1. Reference Dependence

Outcomes are evaluated as gains and losses relative to a reference point, not as final states.

**The reference point:**
- Usually the status quo
- Can be an expectation or aspiration
- Can be what you feel entitled to

**Implication:** The same objective outcome can be a gain or a loss depending on the reference point. Anthony starting with $1M sees $2M as a gain. Betty starting with $4M sees $2M as a loss.

### 2. Diminishing Sensitivity

The psychological difference between $100 and $200 is greater than between $1,100 and $1,200.

**Follows the same pattern as perception:**
- Turning on a dim light in a dark room vs. a bright room
- The same sound seems louder or quieter depending on background
- Subjective impact depends on the baseline

**For money:** The difference between $900 and $1,000 matters less than the difference between $0 and $100.

### 3. Loss Aversion

**The central insight:** Losses loom larger than corresponding gains.

**The coefficient:** Roughly 2:1. Losing $100 feels about as bad as gaining $200 feels good.

**Evidence everywhere:**
- People refuse 50/50 bets to win $150 or lose $100
- Selling prices exceed buying prices for the same object
- Negotiators work harder to avoid losses than to achieve gains
- Golfers putt more accurately to save par than to make birdie

## The Fourfold Pattern

Risk attitudes depend on both probability and whether you face gains or losses:

| | High Probability | Low Probability |
|---|---|---|
| **Gains** | Risk-averse (certainty effect) | Risk-seeking (possibility effect) |
| **Losses** | Risk-seeking (hope for escape) | Risk-averse (fear of loss) |

**Examples:**

1. **High probability gain:** 95% chance of $10,000 OR $9,500 certain
   - Most prefer the sure thing (risk-averse)
   - This explains insurance purchase

2. **Low probability gain:** 5% chance of $10,000 OR $500 certain
   - Most prefer the gamble (risk-seeking)
   - This explains lottery ticket purchase

3. **High probability loss:** 95% chance of losing $10,000 OR lose $9,500 certain
   - Most prefer the gamble (risk-seeking)
   - This explains desperate gambling to avoid ruin

4. **Low probability loss:** 5% chance of losing $10,000 OR lose $500 certain
   - Most prefer the sure loss (risk-averse)
   - This explains excessive insurance for unlikely events

## Key Implications

### The Endowment Effect

People value things more once they own them. Losing something you have hurts more than not getting something you don't have.

**Classic study:** Give half the subjects a mug. Ask them to trade. Almost no trading occurs. Owners value mugs at $7; non-owners value them at $3.

**Implication:** The status quo has inherent value. Change creates losers who feel losses more keenly than winners feel gains.

### Narrow Framing

People evaluate choices one at a time rather than as part of a portfolio.

**The problem:** If you face many small gambles, you should accept all positive-expected-value bets. But loss aversion for each individual bet leads you to reject favorable gambles you'd accept as a package.

**Samuelson's colleague:** Refused a 50/50 bet to win $200 or lose $100. Would accept 100 such bets. This is inconsistent but psychologically real.

### Framing Effects

The same problem framed differently produces different choices.

**The Asian Disease Problem:**
- "400 people will die" vs. "200 people will be saved" (out of 600)
- Same outcome, different preferences

Frame as gains → risk-averse choices
Frame as losses → risk-seeking choices

**Implication:** Rational choice theory requires that equivalent framings produce equivalent choices. Real humans violate this constantly.

## Practical Applications

1. **Negotiation:** Anchor high, make concessions feel like gains to the other party
2. **Communication:** Frame outcomes as gains from status quo when seeking acceptance
3. **Risk management:** Aggregate small risks rather than evaluating each separately
4. **Incentives:** Losses motivate more than equivalent gains—but create resentment
5. **Investment:** Check if you're holding losers due to loss aversion rather than rational expectation
