# Overconfidence

Overconfidence is perhaps the most pervasive and damaging bias. It stems from WYSIATI—we build coherent stories from limited information without acknowledging what we don't know.

## The Illusion of Understanding

We think we understand the past, which gives us false confidence about predicting the future.

**Hindsight bias:** Once you know the outcome, the past seems inevitable. You can construct a compelling narrative explaining why it happened. But you couldn't have predicted it beforehand.

**The narrative fallacy:** We constantly construct explanatory stories. The stories feel true because they're coherent, not because they're supported by evidence

**Google vs. other startups:** In hindsight, Google's success seems inevitable. But thousands of equally promising startups failed. The story we tell about Google is shaped by knowing the outcome.

## The Illusion of Validity

Confidence in a judgment has little correlation with its accuracy.

**The Army Interview Study:** Kahneman interviewed soldiers to predict their success as officers. His confidence in predictions was high. Actual validity was near zero. Yet knowing this didn't reduce his confidence in subsequent interviews.

**Stock pickers:** Active fund managers are confident in their ability to beat the market. Most fail to do so over any meaningful period. Their confidence is an illusion.

**The lesson:** Subjective confidence is determined by the coherence of the story you construct, not by the quality of evidence supporting it.

## When Can We Trust Expert Intuition?

Kahneman collaborated with Gary Klein, who studies successful expert intuition, to answer this question.

**Two conditions for valid intuition:**
1. An environment with sufficient regularity to be predictable
2. Prolonged practice with rapid, clear feedback

**Where intuition works:**
- Chess masters (regular patterns, immediate feedback)
- Firefighters sensing danger (consistent cues over many fires)
- Physicians with acute conditions (clear cause-effect)

**Where intuition fails:**
- Stock picking (environment too random)
- Political forecasting (poor feedback loops)
- Long-term business strategy (too many variables)
- Psychiatric diagnosis (low regularity, poor feedback)

**The key question:** Is the environment regular enough, and has the expert had enough practice with feedback, to develop genuine skill? If not, their confidence is likely unfounded.

## Optimism and Entrepreneurship

Optimism is largely inherited and generally beneficial for life. But it leads to systematic business errors.

**Entrepreneur delusion:**
- 35% of small businesses survive 5 years
- Entrepreneurs estimate their own chances at 70%+
- 33% say their chance of failure is zero

**Competition neglect:** Entrepreneurs focus on their own capabilities and neglect that competitors are doing the same thing. Like Disney executives releasing five blockbusters on the same weekend.

**Planning fallacy:** Plans are best-case scenarios. We focus on what we will do, not on what could go wrong or what competitors will do.

## CFO Overconfidence Study

Duke researchers asked CFOs to estimate S&P 500 returns with 80% confidence intervals.

**Results:**
- Actual correlation between predictions and outcomes: slightly negative
- 67% of outcomes fell outside the 80% confidence intervals (should be 20%)
- CFOs had no idea the market would move, but were confident anyway

**To achieve actual 80% confidence:** CFOs would need to say "between -10% and +30%" instead of their typical 5-point ranges.

**The social problem:** A CFO who admits such uncertainty would be laughed out of the room. Society rewards confident forecasts, even when they're worthless.

## The Premortem: A Partial Remedy

Gary Klein's technique for reducing overconfidence in plans:

**The procedure:**
1. When a plan is nearly finalized but not committed
2. Gather knowledgeable people
3. State: "Imagine we are a year into the future. We implemented this plan. The outcome was a disaster."
4. Take 5-10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster
5. Share and discuss

**Why it works:**
- Overcomes groupthink (once a decision appears made, doubts are suppressed)
- Legitimizes dissent
- Unleashes imagination in a needed direction
- Creates permission to voice concerns

**Limitations:** Not a panacea. Doesn't prevent all disasters. But reduces damage from WYSIATI and uncritical optimism.

## The Outside View

Daniel Kahneman's single most actionable recommendation:

**The inside view:** Making predictions based on the specific case, its unique features, your plans and capabilities.

**The outside view:** Asking "What happened when others attempted similar things?" Treating your case as one instance of a reference class.

**Curriculum planning example:** Kahneman's team estimated 18-30 months to finish a textbook. An expert on curriculum design said similar projects took 7-10 years, with 40% never finishing. The book took 8 years.

**How to take the outside view:**
1. Identify an appropriate reference class
2. Obtain statistics for that class (base rates)
3. Use those statistics as a baseline
4. Adjust for distinguishing features of your case (but adjust less than you think)

**Why we don't do this:** The inside view feels relevant. The outside view feels like ignoring important information. But the outside view is almost always more accurate.

## Speaking of Overconfidence

Phrases to recognize the pattern:

- "They have an illusion of control. They seriously underestimate the obstacles."
- "They seem to suffer from an acute case of competitor neglect."
- "This is a case of overconfidence. They seem to believe they know more than they actually do know."
- "We should conduct a premortem session. Someone may come up with a threat we have neglected."
