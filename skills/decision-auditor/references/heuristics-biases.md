## Availability Bias

**Signs you're affected:**
- Your estimate is heavily influenced by recent news or vivid personal experiences
- Examples came to mind easily, so you assumed they're common
- You're overweighting dramatic events (plane crashes) vs mundane ones (car accidents)
- Media coverage is shaping your risk assessment

**How to fix it:**
- Ask: "What equally relevant examples are harder to recall?"
- Check actual statistics rather than relying on ease of recall
- Consider: "Am I estimating frequency or ease of remembering?"

## Representativeness Bias

**Signs you're affected:**
- You're judging probability by how well something matches a stereotype
- You're ignoring how common each category actually is (base rates)
- A small sample feels as representative as a large one
- A more specific scenario feels more likely than a general one ("feminist bank teller" vs "bank teller")

**How to fix it:**
- Ask: "What are the base rates? How common is this category?"
- Start from base rates, then adjust for specific features
- Remember: specific scenarios can't be more likely than general ones

## Anchoring

**Signs you're affected:**
- Someone suggested an initial number and you adjusted from there
- Your estimate would be different with a different starting point
- You're uncertain about the true value (anchoring is strongest here)
- A random or irrelevant number influenced your judgment

**How to fix it:**
- Generate alternative starting points deliberately
- Ask: "What would I estimate if I started from the opposite extreme?"
- Consider whether you've been anchored by someone else's framing

## Affect Heuristic

**Signs you're affected:**
- You like the people/company/idea, so you see more benefits and fewer risks
- You dislike something, so you see fewer benefits and more risks
- Your risk assessment changed when you learned about benefits (or vice versa)
- You're answering "How do I feel about this?" instead of "What do I think about this?"

**How to fix it:**
- Separate your emotional response from your analysis
- Ask: "Would I make the same assessment if I felt neutral about this?"
- Have someone who doesn't share your feelings evaluate it

## Substitution

**Signs you're affected:**
- You answered a related but easier question than the one asked
- The answer came quickly and confidently
- Common substitutions:
  - "Will this succeed?" → "Do I like this?"
  - "Is this person competent?" → "Did they make a good impression?"
  - "Is this risk significant?" → "Can I easily imagine it happening?"

**How to fix it:**
- Explicitly state the question you're trying to answer
- Check: "Did I answer THAT question, or a different one?"
- Slow down when answers come too easily

## WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)

**Signs you're affected:**
- The decision feels obvious based on limited information
- You're highly confident despite having incomplete data
- You've built a coherent story without checking what's missing
- "The case is clear-cut" or "This is obviously right"

**How to fix it:**
- List what you DON'T know before evaluating what you do know
- Ask: "What information would change my assessment?"
- Treat high confidence from limited data as a warning sign

## Overconfidence

**Signs you're affected:**
- Your confidence intervals are too narrow
- You're rarely surprised by outcomes
- You can't articulate what would prove you wrong
- You've never tracked your prediction accuracy

**How to fix it:**
- Widen your confidence intervals
- Ask: "What would have to be true for me to be wrong?"
- Consider: "If I'm 80% confident, I should be wrong 20% of the time. Is my track record consistent?"

## Planning Fallacy

**Signs you're affected:**
- Your estimates are based on best-case scenarios
- You haven't checked what similar projects actually took
- You're treating your case as special without justification
- Time/cost/effort estimates feel comfortable and achievable

**How to fix it:**
- Find base rates: What did similar projects take?
- Ask: "What could go wrong?"
- Use the outside view: assume you're not special unless you have evidence

## Hindsight Bias

**Signs you're affected:**
- The outcome seems obvious in retrospect
- You believe you "knew it all along"
- You're judging a past decision by its outcome rather than the information available at the time
- You're having trouble learning from experience because you misremember what you believed

**How to fix it:**
- Document predictions BEFORE outcomes are known
- Ask: "What did I actually believe before I knew the result?"
- Judge decisions by the process, not just the outcome

## Halo Effect

**Signs you're affected:**
- Your overall impression of someone/something colors all your judgments
- A confident speaker's ideas seem better
- An attractive candidate seems more competent
- One positive trait makes everything seem positive

**How to fix it:**
- Evaluate specific attributes independently
- Get assessments from multiple people before discussing
- Ask: "Would I judge this trait the same way if my overall impression were different?"

## Summary Table

| Bias | Detection Sign | Quick Fix |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Availability | Easy recall → high estimate | Check actual statistics |
| Representativeness | Matches stereotype → seems likely | Start from base rates |
| Anchoring | Estimate influenced by starting point | Generate alternative anchors |
| Affect | Like it → low risk perception | Separate feelings from analysis |
| Substitution | Quick, confident answer | Check if you answered the actual question |
| WYSIATI | Obvious from limited info | List what you don't know |
| Overconfidence | Narrow confidence intervals | Widen estimates, articulate what would prove you wrong |
| Planning fallacy | Comfortable estimates | Check what similar projects took |
| Hindsight | Outcome seems obvious now | Document predictions beforehand |
| Halo effect | Overall impression colors specifics | Evaluate traits independently |
