# Anti-Patterns in Decision Making

Common mistakes Kahneman identifies, why they happen, and how to avoid them.

## 1. Answering a Different Question

**The pattern:** When faced with a hard question, System 1 substitutes an easier one and answers that instead.

**Examples:**
- Asked "Should I invest in this stock?" → Answers "Do I like this company?"
- Asked "Will this candidate succeed?" → Answers "Does she interview well?"
- Asked "How likely is this risk?" → Answers "How easily can I imagine it?"

**Why it happens:** Substitution is effortless and unconscious. The answer to the easy question feels like an answer to the hard one.

**How to avoid:**
- Explicitly state the exact question you're trying to answer
- Check if your reasoning actually addresses that question
- Ask: "Am I evaluating what I should be evaluating?"

## 2. Ignoring Base Rates

**The pattern:** Overweighting specific information and ignoring how common something is in general.

**Examples:**
- Thinking "Steve sounds like a librarian" without considering there are 20× more farmers
- Assuming a successful startup will stay successful without considering failure rates
- Believing your project will finish on time despite most projects running late

**Why it happens:** Vivid, specific information activates System 1. Abstract statistics don't.

**How to avoid:**
- Always ask: "What are the base rates?"
- Start from the base rate and adjust from there
- Treat your case as one instance of a reference class

## 3. The Planning Fallacy

**The pattern:** Plans are best-case scenarios that underestimate time, cost, and risks while overestimating benefits.

**Examples:**
- Home renovation budgets
- Software project timelines
- Startup business plans
- Personal goals for the year

**Why it happens:**
- Focus on the specific plan, not on what could go wrong
- Competition neglect: ignoring what others will do
- Anchoring on ideal-case scenarios
- WYSIATI: not considering unknown unknowns

**How to avoid:**
- Take the outside view: What happened to similar projects?
- Build in buffers explicitly
- Conduct a premortem
- Multiply your estimate by a reference class factor (typically 2-3×)

## 4. Overconfidence in Judgment

**The pattern:** Confidence is determined by coherence of the story, not quality of evidence.

**Examples:**
- CFOs confident in market predictions with zero accuracy
- Interviewers confident in candidates they can't actually predict
- Investors certain about stocks based on stories, not data

**Why it happens:**
- WYSIATI: We don't notice what we don't know
- System 1 generates coherent narratives automatically
- Social pressure rewards confidence
- Hindsight bias makes past look predictable

**How to avoid:**
- Ask: "What would make me wrong?"
- Consider alternative scenarios explicitly
- Use confidence intervals instead of point estimates
- Check track record of similar predictions

## 5. Theory-Induced Blindness

**The pattern:** Once you accept a theory, you fail to notice its flaws or contradictory evidence.

**Examples:**
- Economists ignoring that utility depends on changes, not states, for 250 years
- Medical professionals persisting with ineffective treatments
- Business leaders following disproven management fads

**Why it happens:**
- The theory provides explanations for anomalies
- Experts give the established view benefit of the doubt
- Disbelieving is effortful; System 2 is lazy

**How to avoid:**
- Take seriously when your theory fails to predict
- Consider whether you're explaining away counterexamples
- Ask: "What would prove this theory wrong?"

## 6. Hindsight Bias

**The pattern:** Once you know the outcome, the past seems more predictable than it was.

**Examples:**
- "I knew the market would crash"
- "That business failure was obvious"
- "Of course the project went over budget"

**Why it happens:** Memory reconstructs the past to be consistent with what we now know. The uncertain feeling of the pre-outcome state is lost.

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Makes learning from experience difficult
- Creates unfair blame for reasonable decisions that didn't work out
- Encourages outcome bias (judging decisions by results, not process)

**How to avoid:**
- Record predictions before outcomes
- Judge decisions based on information available at the time
- Consider other outcomes that could plausibly have happened

## 7. Neglecting Regression to the Mean

**The pattern:** Attributing regression to causes other than statistics.

**Examples:**
- "The Sports Illustrated cover jinx" (athletes regress after peak)
- "Punishment works better than reward" (after bad performance, improvement is expected)
- "They got complacent after success" (extreme performance naturally regresses)

**Why it happens:** System 1 seeks causal explanations for all patterns. Statistical regression doesn't satisfy this need.

**How to avoid:**
- Ask: "Was the previous performance extreme?"
- Expect regression after exceptional results
- Don't conclude causation from one observation

## 8. Narrow Framing

**The pattern:** Evaluating each decision in isolation rather than as part of a broader portfolio.

**Examples:**
- Rejecting positive-expected-value bets because of loss aversion
- Agonizing over small purchase decisions that sum to little
- Taking insurance on individual items when self-insuring would be cheaper

**Why it happens:** We encounter decisions one at a time. Aggregating requires deliberate effort.

**How to avoid:**
- Ask: "Is this one of a class of similar decisions?"
- Think in terms of policies, not individual choices
- Calculate expected value of repeated decisions

## 9. Duration Neglect in Evaluation

**The pattern:** Judging experiences by peaks and endings, ignoring duration.

**Examples:**
- Rating a 3-hour movie by its best scene and ending
- Judging a 10-year relationship by how it ended
- Evaluating a vacation by highlights, not by total pleasant time

**Why it happens:** The remembering self stores representative moments, not duration-weighted averages.

**How to avoid:**
- Explicitly consider duration when evaluating
- Distinguish evaluation of experience from evaluation of memory
- Design experiences to end well, regardless of length

## 10. Focusing Illusion

**The pattern:** Overweighting whatever you're currently thinking about.

**Examples:**
- "Californians must be happier" (when thinking about climate)
- "This promotion will change everything" (when thinking about promotion)
- "Paraplegics must be miserable" (when thinking about disability)

**Why it happens:** Whatever is attended to seems more important. We forget we won't think about it much.

**How to avoid:**
- Ask: "How much will I actually think about this?"
- Consider what else will be on my mind
- Remember that adaptation is the norm
