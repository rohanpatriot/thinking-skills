# The Two Selves

Beyond the two systems of thinking, Kahneman identifies two selves with different interests: the experiencing self and the remembering self.

## The Experiencing Self

**Who it is:** The one who lives life moment to moment. Answers "Does it hurt now?" and "Am I enjoying this?"

**How it's measured:**
- Continuous hedonimeter readings
- Experience sampling (random beeps asking about current state)
- Day Reconstruction Method (detailed recall of yesterday's episodes)

**What affects it:**
- Current activity and environment
- Physical state (pain, comfort, hunger)
- Social interaction (who you're with)
- Attention and engagement

## The Remembering Self

**Who it is:** The one who keeps score and makes decisions. Answers "How was it, on the whole?" and "Would I do it again?"

**How it works:**
- Stores representative moments, not duration-weighted sums
- Disproportionately weights peaks and endings
- Neglects duration almost entirely
- Constructs narratives

**The key insight:** We identify with our remembering self. When we say "I," we mean the remembering self, not the moment-to-moment experiencer.

## Duration Neglect

The remembering self largely ignores how long an experience lasted.

**The colonoscopy study:**
- Patient A: 8 minutes, moderate pain throughout, ends abruptly at high pain
- Patient B: 24 minutes, same profile as A for first 8 minutes, then 16 more minutes at declining pain
- Patient B experienced more total pain
- Patient B remembered it as less painful (better ending)

**Implications:**
- A painful procedure with a gradual ending leaves a better memory
- A wonderful vacation is remembered by its highlights and conclusion, not its length
- Twenty years of happy marriage remembered poorly if it ended badly

## The Peak-End Rule

Memories of experiences are dominated by two moments:
1. The peak (most intense moment)
2. The end (how it concluded)

**The cold-hand experiment:**
- Short trial: 60 seconds at 14°C (painful)
- Long trial: 60 seconds at 14°C, then 30 more seconds as water warms slightly
- Participants chose to repeat the long trial (80% when ending improved)
- They preferred 30 seconds of additional pain because it created a better memory

**This is irrational by any objective measure:** People chose more total suffering because the ending was less bad.

## Conflict Between the Selves

The two selves often have different interests:

**Medical decisions:**
- Experiencing self: Minimize total pain during procedure
- Remembering self: Minimize memory of pain afterward
- These lead to different optimal strategies

**Vacations:**
- Experiencing self: Maximize pleasant moments
- Remembering self: Maximize memorable highlights
- Tourism caters to the remembering self; resorts to the experiencing self

**Amnesic vacation thought experiment:**
> All photos will be destroyed. You'll take a potion that erases all memories of the trip.
> How does this change your vacation plans?

Most people would pay far less for this vacation. We care primarily about memories, not experiences.

## Life Satisfaction vs. Experienced Well-Being

These are different things, measured differently:

**Life satisfaction (remembering self):**
- Global evaluation when you think about your life
- Heavily influenced by what you're thinking about at the moment
- Affected by life circumstances, goals achieved
- Higher income → higher satisfaction (no satiation point found)

**Experienced well-being (experiencing self):**
- How you feel as you live your life
- Measured by U-index (% of time in unpleasant state)
- Affected by current activity, social contact, health
- Income satiation around $75,000 (in 2010 dollars)

**Key findings:**
- Education raises life satisfaction but not daily feelings
- Illness devastates daily experience more than life evaluation
- Children reduce positive affect in the moment but may increase life satisfaction
- Income beyond satiation buys more pleasure but reduced ability to enjoy small things

## The Focusing Illusion

**The core insight:**
> "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it."

**The California happiness myth:**
- People believe Californians are happier than Midwesterners
- Californians and Midwesterners both believe this
- Actual life satisfaction is identical
- Climate matters when you think about climate; you rarely think about climate

**The paraplegic question:**
> What proportion of the day do paraplegics spend in a bad mood?

People vastly overestimate. Paraplegics are in good moods most of the time—they're working, reading, talking with friends. They think about their condition only when reminded of it.

**Adaptation:** We adapt to most permanent life circumstances by not thinking about them. Exceptions: chronic pain, constant noise, severe depression.

## Practical Implications

1. **Experience design:** If you want people to remember an experience positively, ensure a good ending and a clear peak moment. Duration matters less.

2. **Evaluate both selves:** When making decisions, ask: "How will this affect my moment-to-moment experience?" AND "What memories will this create?"

3. **Beware the focusing illusion:** The thing you're thinking about seems more important than it is. The promotion, the house, the relationship—will you actually think about it as much as you imagine?

4. **Time use matters:** The experiencing self cares about how you spend your time. Commuting and passive leisure score poorly. Socializing and exercise score well.

5. **Goals shape satisfaction:** What you want at 18 affects how satisfied you are at 40. Setting unachievable goals guarantees disappointment.

## Speaking of Two Selves

- "You're thinking of your failed marriage entirely from the perspective of the remembering self. A divorce is like a symphony with a screeching sound at the end—the fact that it ended badly doesn't mean it was all bad."

- "This is a bad case of duration neglect. You're giving the good and bad parts equal weight, although the good part lasted ten times as long."

- "She's devoting her entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps she should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable."
