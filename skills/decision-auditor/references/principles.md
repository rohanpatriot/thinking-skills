# Decision Principles

Actionable rules for better judgment. Use these as checks during decision-making.

## 1. Check for Missing Information (WYSIATI)

**When to apply:** Before any significant decision

**Action:**
1. List what you know
2. List what you DON'T know but would be relevant
3. If confidence is high but list #2 is long, slow down

**Warning signs:**
- "The case is clear-cut"
- "This is obviously the right choice"
- Snap judgments that feel compelling

## 2. Take the Outside View

**When to apply:** Estimating time, cost, success probability

**Action:**
1. Identify the reference class (similar projects/decisions/situations)
2. Find the base rates for that class
3. Start your estimate from the base rate
4. Adjust for specific features (but adjust LESS than you think you should)

**Example transformation:**
- Inside view: "Our project plan is solid, we'll finish in 6 months"
- Outside view: "Similar projects take 18-24 months. Start there."

## 3. Expect Regression to the Mean

**When to apply:** After any extreme performance

**Action:**
- Don't over-reward one good performance
- Don't over-punish one bad performance
- Expect the next result to be closer to average
- Before attributing cause, ask: "Could this just be regression?"

**Common trap:** Praise seems to cause decline (regression) while criticism seems to cause improvement (also regression). Both are just statistical noise.

## 4. Separate Diagnosis from Decision

**When to apply:** Group decisions, situations with desired outcomes

**Action:**
1. Gather information BEFORE revealing preferences
2. In groups, have people write assessments before discussion
3. Use structured evaluation before holistic judgment

**Why:** Once you know what you want, System 1 constructs supporting evidence and ignores contrary evidence.

## 5. Consider the Opposite

**When to apply:** When confident, when confirming existing beliefs

**Action:**
- Ask: "What would make this wrong?"
- List three reasons for the alternative view
- Assign someone to argue the opposite position

**Effect:** Reduces anchoring, confirmation bias, and overconfidence.

## 6. Use Simple Rules for Repeated Decisions

**When to apply:** Hiring, diagnosis, any repeatable judgment

**Action:**
1. Identify the key factors
2. Weight them equally (unless you have strong evidence otherwise)
3. Don't override the formula based on "intuition" or "this case is special"

**Evidence:** Simple models beat expert judgment in virtually every comparison study. Algorithms are consistent; experts are influenced by mood, recency, and fatigue.

## 7. Aggregate Independent Judgments

**When to apply:** Before group discussion

**Action:**
1. Have everyone write their assessment independently
2. Average these to get a starting point
3. Use discussion to surface information, not to persuade

**Why:** Random errors cancel out when averaging. Discussion introduces conformity bias.

## 8. Think Statistically

**When to apply:** When you notice a pattern

**Action:**
- Ask: "Could this be chance?"
- Consider sample size
- Separate correlation from causation

**Quick check:** Specific scenarios can't be more likely than general ones. "Linda is a feminist bank teller" cannot be more probable than "Linda is a bank teller."

## 9. Make Decisions from the Future

**When to apply:** Before commitment, especially high-stakes decisions

**Techniques:**
- **Premortem:** "It's a year from now and this failed. What happened?" (See [workflows/premortem.md](../workflows/premortem.md))
- **Prospective hindsight:** "How will I feel about this choice in ten years?"
- **Regret minimization:** "Which choice will I regret less if it doesn't work out?"

## 10. Account for Loss Aversion

**When to apply:** Proposals that involve change, negotiations

**Facts:**
- Losses hurt ~2x as much as equivalent gains feel good
- People value what they have more than what they could get

**Action:**
- When proposing changes, acknowledge what people will lose
- Frame outcomes as gains from current state when seeking acceptance
- In negotiation, understand the other party's loss frame

## 11. Broaden the Frame

**When to apply:** Risk decisions, recurring choices

**Action:**
- Ask: "Is this decision part of a larger class?"
- If you face many similar decisions, think about the POLICY, not each instance
- A risk you wouldn't take alone may be worth taking as part of a portfolio

**Example:** A 50/50 chance to win $200 or lose $100 seems scary alone. But accepting 100 such bets is nearly certain to be profitable.

## 12. Remember Peak-End Rule

**When to apply:** Designing experiences, evaluating past events

**Fact:** The remembering self weights peaks and endings, not duration.

**Action:**
- End experiences well, even painful ones
- Create clear peak moments in positive experiences
- A shorter great experience beats a longer mediocre one

## Quick Reference

| Principle | Trigger | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Check for missing info | High confidence | List what you don't know |
| Outside view | Estimating | Find base rates first |
| Regression | Extreme result | Expect return to average |
| Separate diagnosis | Group decision | Write before discussing |
| Consider opposite | Confirming belief | List reasons you're wrong |
| Use rules | Repeated decision | Create and follow a formula |
| Aggregate | Before discussion | Average independent estimates |
| Think statistically | Pattern spotted | Ask "could this be chance?" |
| Future perspective | Before commitment | Run a premortem |
| Loss aversion | Proposing change | Acknowledge what's being lost |
| Broaden frame | Single risk decision | Consider as part of portfolio |
| Peak-end | Designing experience | Focus on peaks and endings |
