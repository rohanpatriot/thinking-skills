# The Two Systems

The central metaphor of Kahneman's framework: two agents with distinct capabilities operating in your mind.

## System 1: The Automatic Mind

**Characteristics:**
- Operates automatically and quickly
- Little or no effort required
- No sense of voluntary control
- Cannot be turned off
- Generates impressions, intuitions, intentions, feelings

**What System 1 Does:**
- Detects that one object is farther than another
- Orients to sudden sounds
- Completes phrases ("bread and...")
- Makes disgust faces at horrible pictures
- Detects hostility in voices
- Answers 2 + 2 = ?
- Reads words on billboards
- Drives a car on an empty road
- Finds strong chess moves (if you're a master)
- Understands simple sentences

**Key Feature - WYSIATI:**
"What You See Is All There Is." System 1 constructs the best possible story from available information. It doesn't flag what's missing. A coherent story feels true, regardless of the quality or quantity of evidence.

## System 2: The Effortful Mind

**Characteristics:**
- Allocates attention to effortful activities
- Associated with subjective experience of agency, choice, concentration
- Can override System 1 (but requires effort)
- Limited capacity - easily depleted
- Lazy - defaults to System 1 when possible

**What System 2 Does:**
- Braces for the starter gun in a race
- Focuses on a specific voice in a crowded room
- Searches memory for a surprising sound
- Maintains faster walking speed than natural
- Monitors appropriateness of behavior
- Counts letter occurrences in text
- Parks in a narrow space
- Compares two products for value
- Fills out a tax form
- Checks validity of complex arguments

**Key Limitation:**
System 2 requires attention. Tasks that demand it interfere with each other. You cannot multiply 17 × 24 while making a left turn into traffic.

## The Division of Labor

The two systems work together most of the time:
1. System 1 continuously generates suggestions (impressions, intuitions, intentions)
2. System 2 normally endorses these with little modification
3. When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2
4. System 2 is activated when an event violates System 1's model of the world

**Why This Matters:**

Most of what you think and do originates in System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult. The arrangement minimizes effort and optimizes performance—but System 1 has biases that System 2 often fails to correct.

## The Gorilla Experiment

Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons showed people a video of basketball players and asked them to count passes by the white team. Halfway through, a gorilla walks across, thumps its chest, and exits. Half the viewers don't see it.

**Two important facts:**
1. We can be blind to the obvious
2. We are blind to our blindness

Attention is a limited budget. System 1's automatic processes depend on some attention being allocated. Intense focus on one task makes people effectively blind to other stimuli.

## Cognitive Strain and Ease

**Cognitive Ease** (System 1 dominant):
- In a good mood
- Believe what you hear
- Trust your intuitions
- Feel situation is familiar
- Experience less vigilance

**Cognitive Strain** (System 2 engaged):
- Feel less comfortable
- More vigilant and suspicious
- Invest more effort
- Make fewer errors
- Less intuitive, less creative

**Practical implication:** You can manipulate your cognitive state. Difficult fonts, frowning, or cold temperatures increase System 2 engagement. But System 2 is easily tired and will default back to System 1.

## The Lazy Controller

System 2 is lazy. It endorses many intuitive beliefs and acts on impulses with little scrutiny. Self-control requires effort and depletes the same limited resource as cognitive tasks.

**Ego depletion:** After exerting self-control (resisting chocolate, suppressing emotion), people perform worse on subsequent tasks requiring self-control. The "self" that controls is a limited resource.

**Flow states:** The exception to the rule. In flow, System 2 is highly engaged but subjectively effortless. Attention is fully focused on the task. These states are intrinsically rewarding.
