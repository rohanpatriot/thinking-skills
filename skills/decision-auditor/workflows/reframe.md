## When to Use

- When a decision feels stuck in one framing
- When there's disagreement that seems to be about facts but might be about framing
- When you suspect loss aversion is driving a decision
- When evaluating a decision someone else has framed

## Getting Started

Before reframing, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to understand the decision context:

1. **How is the decision currently presented?** Get the exact language being used.
2. **Who framed it this way?** The source of framing affects how entrenched it may be.
3. **What's the implicit reference point?** Often reveals whether gains or losses are being emphasized.
4. **What options are on the table?** Understanding the choice set helps identify narrow framing.

This information is essential—you can't reframe what you don't fully understand.

## The Core Insight

The same objective situation, framed differently, produces different choices:
- "90% survival rate" vs "10% mortality rate"
- "Save 200 people" vs "Let 400 people die"
- "$5 discount" vs "$5 surcharge avoided"

Rational agents should make the same choice regardless of framing. Humans don't.

## The Process

### Step 1: Document the Current Frame

Write out the decision as currently presented:
- How is the choice described?
- What is the reference point?
- What is framed as a gain? As a loss?
- What options are presented?

### Step 2: Identify the Reference Point

Every frame has an implicit reference point:
- Status quo (current state)
- Expectation (what you thought would happen)
- Aspiration (what you wanted to happen)
- Entitlement (what you feel you deserve)

**Question:** What reference point is being used? Is it the right one?

### Step 3: Flip Gains and Losses

Restate the decision with gains as losses and vice versa:

**Original:** "Program A saves 200 lives (out of 600)"
**Reframed:** "Program A lets 400 people die (out of 600)"

**Original:** "Accept this deal and gain $100"
**Reframed:** "Reject this deal and miss out on $100"

**Question:** Does your preference change? If so, your original preference was frame-dependent.

### Step 4: Change the Reference Point

Restate the decision with a different reference point:

**Reference: Status Quo**
"We can change the policy and risk losing customers."

**Reference: Where We Should Be**
"We're not serving customers well; changing policy could fix that."

**Reference: Competitor**
"Competitors have this policy; we don't."

**Question:** Does the decision look different from each reference point?

### Step 5: Broaden the Frame

Expand the scope of what's being considered:

**Narrow frame:** "Should I take this gamble?"
**Broader frame:** "Given all the similar decisions I'll make, what's my policy?"

**Narrow frame:** "Should we approve this project?"
**Broader frame:** "What's our portfolio of projects and how does this fit?"

### Step 6: Disaggregate vs. Aggregate

Sometimes combining things hides issues; sometimes separating them does:

**Aggregated:** "Total cost of the project is $50M"
**Disaggregated:** "Development: $20M, Marketing: $15M, Contingency: $15M"

**Disaggregated:** "We need to make decisions A, B, and C"
**Aggregated:** "We need a strategy that addresses all three issues"

### Step 7: Restate as Pure Information

Remove emotional framing:

**Emotional:** "This disaster will devastate our reputation"
**Informational:** "If this outcome occurs, we expect customer perception scores to decrease by X"

**Emotional:** "This is an incredible opportunity"
**Informational:** "This option has expected value X with variance Y"

### Step 8: Consider Joint vs. Separate Evaluation

Decisions look different when options are evaluated together vs. separately:

**Separate evaluation:** "Is option A good?" (Yes) "Is option B good?" (Yes)
**Joint evaluation:** "Which is better, A or B?" (Often reveals a clear winner)

**Implication:** Important attributes emerge when comparing options that don't emerge when evaluating them alone.

### Step 9: Test Frame Independence

Make the recommendation that survives all framings:

- Does the choice change with different frames?
- If yes, which frame is most appropriate?
- What decision would a neutral observer make?

## Common Reframing Situations

### Negotiation
- Seller's frame: "I'm giving up my house"
- Buyer's frame: "I'm getting a new house"
- Frame-independent: "Transaction at price X"

### Risk Decisions
- Frame 1: "95% chance of success"
- Frame 2: "5% chance of failure"
- Frame-independent: Consider both and decide if acceptable

### Policy Changes
- Frame 1: "What will we lose?"
- Frame 2: "What will we gain?"
- Frame-independent: Net value of change

### Investment Decisions
- Frame 1: "Don't sell at a loss" (reference: purchase price)
- Frame 2: "Given current price, is this the best use of these funds?"
- Frame-independent: Expected future value
