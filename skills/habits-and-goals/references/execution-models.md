# Execution Models

Three mental models for consistent execution of your Daily Systems.

---

## 1. The ABC System

**Sahil's favorite approach for sustainable execution.**

### The Three Levels

| Level | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **A** | Most ambitious, perfect case | Great days with full energy and time |
| **B** | Middle ground, base case | Normal days, standard conditions |
| **C** | Minimum viable level | Tough days, sick, traveling, overwhelmed |

### Core Philosophy

> The optimal (A) shouldn't get in the way of beneficial (C).

- **Anything above zero compounds** — A C day is infinitely better than a zero day
- Perfection is the enemy of consistency
- C keeps the streak alive when A isn't possible

### How to Set ABC Levels

For each Daily System:

1. **Start with B (Base):** What's a reasonable daily effort?
2. **Define A (Ambitious):** What's the ideal if everything goes right?
3. **Define C (Minimum):** What's the absolute minimum to maintain the habit?

### Example: Daily Writing

From Sahil Bloom's personal practice:

| Level | Duration | Context |
|-------|----------|---------|
| A | 60 minutes | Peak days, deep focus available |
| B | 45 minutes | Normal working day |
| C | 15 minutes | Travel, sick, busy |

### Example: Daily Exercise

| Level | Activity | Context |
|-------|----------|---------|
| A | Full gym workout (60 min) | Normal day, gym accessible |
| B | 30-minute run or bodyweight workout | Moderate time available |
| C | 10-minute walk | Sick, exhausted, traveling |

### Implementation Tips

- Write down your ABC levels for each Daily System
- Don't negotiate below C — that's your line
- Celebrate C days as wins, not failures
- Track which level you hit each day to spot patterns

## 2. The Two-Day Rule

**Never skip more than one day in a row.**

### The Principle

When building any habit or Daily System:
- One day off is rest
- Two days off is the start of a new pattern
- The goal is to never allow two consecutive zeros

### Research Backing

The European Journal of Social Psychology found:
- Habit formation takes 18-254 days (average 66 days)
- Consistency matters more than intensity
- Single misses don't significantly impact habit formation
- Consecutive misses derail progress dramatically

### Application

1. **Planned rest:** Build in intentional rest days (e.g., Sunday off)
2. **Unplanned miss:** If you miss Monday, Tuesday is non-negotiable
3. **C-level saves:** Use your minimum viable C-level to prevent consecutive zeros

### The Math

| Pattern | Yearly Result |
|---------|---------------|
| Daily | 365 days |
| 6 days/week | 312 days |
| Miss 2 in a row occasionally | Habit breaks, restart required |

### Combining with ABC System

The Two-Day Rule becomes easier with ABC levels:
- Day 1: Miss completely (life happens)
- Day 2: Must hit at least C level
- This prevents the chain from breaking

## 3. The 30-for-30 Approach

**30 minutes per day for 30 straight days.**

### The Formula

- **30 minutes:** Long enough to make progress, short enough to be sustainable
- **30 days:** Long enough to establish a pattern, short enough to commit
- **900 minutes total:** Accumulated effort creates real results

### Why These Numbers Work

**30 Minutes:**
- Below the resistance threshold for most people
- Enough time for meaningful work
- Easy to protect in any schedule

**30 Days:**
- Crosses the initial habit formation threshold
- Creates visible results that motivate continuation
- Short enough to feel achievable from day one

### When to Use 30-for-30

- **Starting a new Daily System** — Use it to establish the habit
- **Restarting a broken habit** — Use it to rebuild momentum
- **Testing a new goal** — Use it to validate before committing to a full year
- **Learning something new** — Accumulate 15 hours of practice

### Implementation

1. Choose ONE new Daily System to establish
2. Commit to exactly 30 minutes (not more, not less initially)
3. Track 30 consecutive days
4. After 30 days, adjust time up or down based on results

### After 30-for-30

Once the 30-day sprint is complete:
- The habit should feel more automatic
- Adjust duration based on your goals (expand to A/B/C levels)
- The foundation is set for year-long consistency

## Combining All Three Models

These models work together:

```
30-for-30
  ↓ (establishes the habit)
ABC System
  ↓ (provides flexibility)
Two-Day Rule
  ↓ (maintains consistency)
Year-Long Progress
```

### Practical Integration

1. **New habit:** Start with 30-for-30 to establish baseline
2. **After 30 days:** Define A/B/C levels for that system
3. **Daily:** Hit whatever level is realistic (A, B, or C)
4. **Always:** Never skip two days in a row (use C-level as backup)

### Example: Starting a Meditation Practice

- **Week 1-4 (30-for-30):** 30 minutes daily, no exceptions
- **After 30 days, set ABC:**
  - A: 30 minutes (full session)
  - B: 15 minutes (shortened session)
  - C: 5 minutes (minimum)
- **Two-Day Rule:** If I miss Saturday, Sunday is at least 5 minutes
- **Result:** 300+ days of meditation by year end
