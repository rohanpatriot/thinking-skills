# Goal-Setting Framework

The Goal-Setting Framework consists of four interconnected components that work together like a mountain climbing expedition.

## The Mountain Climbing Metaphor

- **Big Goals** = The summit you're climbing toward
- **Checkpoint Goals** = Campsites along the way
- **Daily Systems** = Your feet moving forward each day
- **Anti-Goals** = What you refuse to sacrifice during the climb

---

## 1. Big Goals

**Definition:** Large, year-long, ambitious goals that serve as your north star.

### Criteria for Big Goals

- **Should scare you a little** — If it doesn't make you slightly uncomfortable, you're thinking too small
- **Ambitious but achievable** — Stretch beyond comfort but remain grounded in reality
- **Clear and specific** — You should know definitively when you've achieved it
- **Meaningful** — Connected to what truly matters to you

### Categories

Organize Big Goals into two primary spheres:

1. **Professional** — Career, business, financial goals
2. **Personal** — Can remain unified or split into:
   - Health
   - Relationships
   - Personal development
   - Other life domains

### Guidance

- Aim for 1-3 Big Goals per category (Professional and Personal)
- More than 3 per category dilutes focus
- Each Big Goal should be independent enough to pursue without conflicting with others

## 2. Checkpoint Goals

**Definition:** Mid-climb campsites that mark progress toward Big Goals.

### How to Create Checkpoint Goals

1. Start with your Big Goal
2. Work backwards: "What must be true by mid-year for this to happen?"
3. Continue working backwards: "What must be true by Q1?"
4. Create 2-4 checkpoints per Big Goal

### Timing Guidance

| Checkpoint | Timing | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| First | End of Q1 | Foundation laid, momentum building |
| Second | Mid-year | Significant progress visible |
| Third | End of Q3 | Final push preparation |
| Fourth | Year-end | Big Goal achievement |

### Relationship to Big Goals

- Checkpoints are derived FROM Big Goals, not created independently
- Each checkpoint should clearly contribute to the Big Goal
- Missing a checkpoint is an early warning signal for course correction

## 3. Daily Systems

**Definition:** Simple, repeatable daily actions that create compounding progress toward your goals.

### Core Principle

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."
> — James Clear

### Guidelines

- **2-3 simple daily actions** per Big Goal maximum
- Actions should be:
  - Small enough to do every day
  - Specific enough to measure
  - Connected clearly to Checkpoint/Big Goals

### The Compounding Effect

Daily systems work through accumulation:
- Day 1: Barely noticeable
- Day 30: Patterns emerging
- Day 90: Visible progress
- Day 365: Transformation

### Examples

| Big Goal | Daily System |
|----------|--------------|
| Write a book | Write for 30 minutes |
| Get healthier | 10,000 steps |
| Build relationships | One meaningful conversation |
| Grow business | 2 hours of deep work on priority project |

---

## 4. Anti-Goals

**Definition:** What you explicitly do NOT want to happen while pursuing your goals — your guardrails.

### The Inversion Approach

> "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."
> — Charlie Munger

Instead of only asking "What do I want?", also ask:
- "What do I NOT want to happen?"
- "What would be winning the battle but losing the war?"
- "What sacrifice would make achieving this goal feel hollow?"

### Common Anti-Goal Categories

- **Health:** Don't sacrifice physical/mental health for professional success
- **Relationships:** Don't neglect family/friends while building career
- **Values:** Don't compromise integrity for achievement
- **Balance:** Don't burn out pursuing a single goal

### How Anti-Goals Function

- Serve as boundaries and guardrails
- Trigger course corrections before it's too late
- Ensure you're playing a game worth winning
- Prevent pyrrhic victories (winning at too high a cost)

### Examples

| Big Goal | Anti-Goal |
|----------|-----------|
| Grow revenue 50% | Don't work more than 50 hours/week |
| Get promoted | Don't miss more than 2 family dinners/week |
| Build new product | Don't sacrifice team morale or culture |
| Write daily | Don't neglect physical health |

## Framework Integration

All four components must work together:

```
Big Goal (Summit)
    ↓
Checkpoint Goals (Campsites)
    ↓
Daily Systems (Footsteps)
    ↔
Anti-Goals (Guardrails)
```

When setting goals:
1. Define Big Goals first
2. Work backwards to create Checkpoint Goals
3. Identify Daily Systems that drive toward checkpoints
4. Use inversion to establish Anti-Goals as boundaries

Monthly, verify all components remain aligned and make course corrections as needed.
