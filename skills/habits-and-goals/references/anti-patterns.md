## 1. Thinking Too Small

**The Problem:** Setting goals that don't scare you.

### Signs You're Thinking Too Small

- The goal feels comfortable and safe
- You're 90%+ confident you can achieve it
- It doesn't require meaningful change in behavior
- You've done something similar before with ease

### Why This Matters

- Goals that don't stretch you don't transform you
- Comfort zone goals lead to comfort zone results
- You'll never know your true potential

### The Fix

Ask yourself: "Does this goal scare me a little?"

If not:
- Double the ambition
- Cut the timeline in half
- Add a constraint that forces creativity
- Ask "What would I do if I couldn't fail?"

## 2. Skipping Two Days in a Row

**The Problem:** Breaking the habit chain by missing consecutive days.

### The Science

- One miss: Minimal impact on habit formation
- Two consecutive misses: Pattern disruption begins
- Three+ consecutive misses: Effectively starting over

### Why This Happens

- "I already missed yesterday, what's one more day?"
- Perfectionist thinking: "If I can't do it perfectly, why bother?"
- No fallback plan when life gets hard

### The Fix

- Implement the Two-Day Rule as a hard boundary
- Use C-level from ABC System when struggling
- Plan for obstacles in advance
- Track streaks visually to create accountability

## 3. Winning the Battle, Losing the War

**The Problem:** Achieving goals at the expense of what truly matters.

### Examples

| "Victory" | Hidden Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| Got the promotion | Destroyed health, gained 30 lbs |
| Hit revenue target | Burned out entire team |
| Published the book | Neglected family for a year |
| Built the company | Lost the marriage |

### Why This Happens

- No Anti-Goals defined
- Tunnel vision on the goal itself
- Delayed consequences aren't visible in the moment
- Culture celebrates achievement without examining cost

### The Fix

- Define Anti-Goals BEFORE you start pursuing Big Goals
- Use monthly check-ins to assess Anti-Goal status
- Ask: "If I achieve this goal but [Anti-Goal happens], was it worth it?"
- Build guardrails into your planning from day one

## 4. Set and Forget

**The Problem:** Creating a plan in January and never revisiting it.

### The 1-in-60 Rule (from Aviation)

A 1-degree navigation error = 1 mile off course for every 60 miles flown.

Applied to annual planning:
- Small misalignments in January become major problems by December
- Life changes, priorities shift, circumstances evolve
- A plan that isn't reviewed becomes a plan that isn't followed

### Why This Happens

- Planning feels like the accomplishment
- No scheduled review rhythm
- Fear of confronting lack of progress
- "Too busy" to stop and assess

### The Fix

- Monthly Check-ins (last Friday of each month)
- Three questions:
  1. Are Big Goals still aligned with what matters?
  2. Are Daily Systems creating appropriate momentum?
  3. Am I in danger of running afoul of Anti-Goals?
- Adjust course before small deviations become large ones

## 5. All Goals, No Systems

**The Problem:** Focusing on outcomes without building the daily infrastructure.

### The Quote

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."
> — James Clear

### What This Looks Like

- Inspiring vision board, no daily actions
- Annual goals without Checkpoint Goals
- Checkpoints without Daily Systems
- Motivation without mechanism

### Why This Happens

- Goals feel good to set
- Systems feel boring to design
- Inspiration is exciting, discipline is hard
- Ideas are cheap, execution is expensive

### The Fix

- For every Big Goal, immediately define 2-3 Daily Systems
- Focus more time on system design than goal setting
- Track Daily System completion, not just goal progress
- Remember: the path creates the destination

---

## 6. Too Many Goals

**The Problem:** Diluting focus across too many priorities.

### The Math

- 1 Big Goal: 100% of discretionary focus
- 3 Big Goals: ~33% each
- 10 Big Goals: 10% each (nothing gets real attention)

### Why This Happens

- Fear of missing out on other areas
- Difficulty choosing what matters most
- Belief that more goals = more ambitious
- Not distinguishing between "want" and "priority"

### The Fix

- Maximum 3 Big Goals per category (Professional/Personal)
- If something is #4+, it's not a priority this year
- "What would I choose if I could only pick one?"
- Better to fully achieve 2 goals than half-achieve 6

---

## 7. No Recovery Mechanism

**The Problem:** No plan for getting back on track after failures.

### What Happens

- Miss a few days → Feel like a failure → Abandon the goal
- Hit an obstacle → No contingency → Paralysis
- Fall behind on Checkpoint → No recovery plan → Give up

### Why This Happens

- Planning assumes everything will go right
- Failure feels like identity, not event
- No pre-commitment to restart process
- Shame spirals prevent rational response

### The Fix

- Build ABC levels for flexibility during hard times
- Two-Day Rule as an automatic restart trigger
- Monthly check-ins to reset and recommit
- Treat setbacks as data, not failure
- "What would I tell a friend who hit this obstacle?"

## Detection Checklist

Use this monthly to spot anti-patterns:

| Question | Red Flag |
|----------|----------|
| Do my goals still scare me a little? | If no, think bigger |
| Have I skipped 2+ consecutive days? | Rebuild streak immediately |
| Am I sacrificing Anti-Goals for progress? | Course correct now |
| When did I last review my plan? | If 30+ days, review today |
| Do I have Daily Systems for each goal? | If not, create them |
| Am I making progress on more than 3 priorities? | Focus more narrowly |
| What's my recovery plan if I fail this week? | If none, create one |
