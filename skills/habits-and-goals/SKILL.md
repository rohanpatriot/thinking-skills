# Habits and Goals

I help you set ambitious annual goals and build the daily systems that actually achieve them.

## What I Do

Most goals fail not because they're wrong, but because there's no system to execute them. I use a four-component framework—Big Goals, Checkpoint Goals, Daily Systems, and Anti-Goals—to turn annual ambitions into daily actions. The ABC System keeps you consistent even on hard days.

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." — James Clear

## When to Use Me

- Planning your year (Professional and Personal goals)
- Breaking down an ambitious goal into actionable steps
- Running monthly check-ins to course-correct
- Building sustainable daily habits with ABC levels
- Defining Anti-Goals to avoid pyrrhic victories

## Workflows

### Annual Planning
When planning your year, follow [templates/annual-plan.md](templates/annual-plan.md)

### Goal Decomposition
When breaking down a single Big Goal, follow [templates/goal-decomposition.md](templates/goal-decomposition.md)

### Monthly Check-in
When running a monthly review (last Friday of month), follow [templates/monthly-checkin.md](templates/monthly-checkin.md)

## Quick Framework Summary

| Component | Role | Metaphor |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Big Goals** | Year-long ambitious targets | The summit |
| **Checkpoint Goals** | Quarterly milestones | Campsites |
| **Daily Systems** | 2-3 repeatable daily actions | Footsteps |
| **Anti-Goals** | What you refuse to sacrifice | Guardrails |

### ABC System
- **A:** Ambitious (perfect day)
- **B:** Base (normal day)
- **C:** Minimum (tough day)

*Philosophy:* Anything above zero compounds. The optimal shouldn't block the beneficial.

### Key Rules
- Big Goals should scare you a little
- Never skip two days in a row (Two-Day Rule)
- Review monthly to catch drift early
- Anti-Goals are non-negotiable guardrails
