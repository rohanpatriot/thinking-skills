# Monthly Check-in Template

Structured review for the last Friday of each month.

---

## Purpose

The 1-in-60 Rule from aviation: A 1-degree error in navigation results in being 1 mile off course for every 60 miles flown.

Applied to annual planning:
- Small misalignments compound over time
- Monthly reviews catch drift early
- Course corrections keep you on track

**Timing:** Last Friday of each month

## Instructions for Claude

When a user requests a monthly check-in, guide them through the three core questions using the `AskUserQuestion` tool.

### Session Flow

#### Opening

"Let's do your monthly check-in. This takes about 15-20 minutes and ensures you're still on track for the year."

#### Question 1: Big Goal Alignment

**Ask:** "Looking at your life right now, what really matters most to you?"

**Follow-up:** "Are your Big Goals still aligned with what matters most, or has something shifted?"

- Options: Still aligned | Need minor adjustments | Major reassessment needed

**If adjustments needed:** "What specifically needs to change?"

#### Question 2: Daily Systems Assessment

**Ask:** "Think about your Daily Systems over the past month. Are they creating the momentum you need toward your Big Goals?"

- Options: Yes, strong momentum | Somewhat, but could be better | No, not working | Haven't been consistent

**Follow-up based on response:**
- If inconsistent: "What got in the way? What would help you be more consistent next month?"
- If not working: "Do the systems need to change, or is it an execution problem?"
- If working well: "Any refinements that would make them even more effective?"

#### Question 3: Anti-Goal Check

**Ask:** "Look at your Anti-Goals—the things you refuse to sacrifice. Are you in danger of violating any of them?"

- Options: All good, staying within guardrails | Yellow flag, need to watch this | Red flag, already violating | Not sure, need to reflect

**Follow-up if issues:** "What specific Anti-Goal is at risk? What would course correction look like?"

#### Closing

Summarize findings and identify 1-3 specific adjustments for the coming month.

## Reminders

**If Big Goals need major changes:**
- This is normal—life evolves
- Better to adjust than pursue outdated goals
- Use the Goal Decomposition template for new goals

**If Daily Systems aren't working:**
- Check if ABC levels are realistic
- Consider 30-for-30 approach to rebuild momentum
- Simplify—fewer systems done consistently beat more systems done sporadically

**If Anti-Goals are at risk:**
- This is the most important warning sign
- Course correct immediately
- Achieving goals at the cost of Anti-Goals is losing

**Remember:** The goal of monthly check-ins is small course corrections, not major overhauls. Catch the 1-degree errors before they become 60-mile misses.
