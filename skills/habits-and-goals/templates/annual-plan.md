## Instructions for Claude

When a user requests annual planning, guide them through this structured session using the `AskUserQuestion` tool.

### Session Flow

#### Phase 1: Category Selection

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:
- "Let's plan your year. Should we start with Professional goals or Personal goals?"
- Options: Professional (career, business, financial) | Personal (health, relationships, growth)

#### Phase 2: Big Goals (Per Category)

For each category, capture 1-3 Big Goals:

**Question 1:** "What is Big Goal #1 for [Professional/Personal]? This should be ambitious and meaningful to you."

**Validation Question:** "Does this goal scare you a little? If it feels comfortable and safe, consider thinking bigger."
- Options: Yes, it stretches me | No, let me revise it | Not sure

**Repeat for Big Goals #2 and #3** (if desired):
- "Do you have a second Big Goal for [category], or should we move on?"
- Options: Add another goal | Move to next phase

#### Phase 3: Checkpoint Goals (Per Big Goal)

For each Big Goal, derive 2-4 Checkpoint Goals:

**Question:** "Let's work backwards from [Big Goal]. What milestone would tell you you're on track by mid-year?"

**Follow-up:** "What needs to be true by the end of Q1 to reach that mid-year checkpoint?"

**Optional:** "Any other checkpoints for Q3 or Q4?"

#### Phase 4: Daily Systems (Per Big Goal)

For each Big Goal, identify 1-3 Daily Systems:

**Question:** "What's the simplest daily action that creates progress toward [Big Goal]? Think small and repeatable."

**ABC Definition:** "Let's set your ABC levels for this system:
- A (great day, full energy): What's the ambitious version?
- B (normal day): What's the realistic baseline?
- C (tough day): What's the absolute minimum?"

#### Phase 5: Anti-Goals (Per Category)

Use inversion to identify guardrails:

**Question:** "Thinking about your [Professional/Personal] goals, what would be 'winning the battle but losing the war'? What outcome would make success feel hollow?"

**Follow-up:** "What specifically do you NOT want to sacrifice while pursuing these goals?"
- Prompt options: Health | Relationships | Values | Time | Energy | Other

#### Phase 6: Summary and Next Steps

After completing both categories:
1. Present complete plan summary
2. Recommend setting up monthly check-ins (last Friday of each month)
3. Suggest tracking Daily Systems starting immediately

## Key Reminders

- **Big Goals should scare you a little** — If they don't, think bigger
- **Daily Systems matter most** — You fall to the level of your systems
- **Use ABC levels** — C days are wins, not failures
- **Never skip two days in a row** — Use Two-Day Rule religiously
- **Review monthly** — Small course corrections prevent major drift
- **Anti-Goals are guardrails** — Check them before celebrating wins
