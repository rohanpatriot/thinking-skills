## Instructions for Claude

When you receive an annual planning request, consider using `EnterPlanMode` first—annual planning is a significant multi-step session that benefits from structured planning. Then guide the user through this session using the `AskUserQuestion` tool.

### Session Flow

#### Phase 1: Category Selection

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Let's plan your year. Should we start with Professional goals or Personal goals?"
- Options: Professional (career, business, financial) | Personal (health, relationships, growth)

#### Phase 2: Big Goals (Per Category)

For each category, capture 1-3 Big Goals:

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What is Big Goal #1 for [Professional/Personal]? This should be ambitious and meaningful to you."
- Options: Let me describe my goal | I need help brainstorming | Show me examples first

**Validation (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Does this goal scare you a little? If it feels comfortable and safe, consider thinking bigger."
- Options: Yes, it stretches me | No, let me revise it | Not sure, help me evaluate

**Repeat for Big Goals #2 and #3 (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Do you have a second Big Goal for [category], or should we move on?"
- Options: Add another goal | Move to next phase

#### Phase 3: Checkpoint Goals (Per Big Goal)

For each Big Goal, derive 2-4 Checkpoint Goals:

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Let's work backwards from [Big Goal]. What milestone would tell you you're on track by mid-year?"
- Options: Let me describe a milestone | Help me identify one | Work backwards together

**Follow-up (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What needs to be true by the end of Q1 to reach that mid-year checkpoint?"
- Options: I have a Q1 milestone | Help me define one | Skip to next phase

#### Phase 4: Daily Systems (Per Big Goal)

For each Big Goal, identify 1-3 Daily Systems:

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What's the simplest daily action that creates progress toward [Big Goal]? Think small and repeatable."
- Options: Time-based (X minutes of...) | Action-based (Do X every day) | Quantity-based (X reps/pages/calls) | Help me identify one

**ABC Definition (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Let's set your ABC levels. What's realistic for A (great day), B (normal day), and C (tough day)?"
- Options: I'll define all three | Help me calibrate levels | Show me examples first

#### Phase 5: Anti-Goals (Per Category)

Use inversion to identify guardrails:

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Thinking about your [Professional/Personal] goals, what would be 'winning the battle but losing the war'? What outcome would make success feel hollow?"
- Options: Health sacrifice | Relationship sacrifice | Values compromise | Time/energy burnout | Let me describe something else

**Follow-up (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What specifically do you refuse to sacrifice while pursuing these goals?"
- Options: Health | Relationships | Values | Time | Energy | Other

#### Phase 6: Summary and Next Steps

After completing both categories:
1. Present complete plan summary
2. Recommend setting up monthly check-ins (last Friday of each month)
3. Suggest tracking Daily Systems starting immediately

## Key Reminders

- **Big Goals should scare you a little** — If they don't, think bigger
- **Daily Systems matter most** — You fall to the level of your systems
- **Use ABC levels** — C days are wins, not failures
- **Never skip two days in a row** — Use Two-Day Rule religiously
- **Review monthly** — Small course corrections prevent major drift
- **Anti-Goals are guardrails** — Check them before celebrating wins
