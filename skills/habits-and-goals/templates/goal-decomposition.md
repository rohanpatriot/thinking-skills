# Goal Decomposition Template

Break down a single Big Goal into actionable Checkpoint Goals, Daily Systems, and Anti-Goals.

---

## When to Use This Template

- You have one specific Big Goal to work through in detail
- You want to reverse-engineer a goal into daily actions
- You're mid-year and adding a new goal to your plan
- You need to rebuild the infrastructure for an existing goal

## Instructions for Claude

When a user wants to decompose a single goal, guide them through this focused session using the `AskUserQuestion` tool.

### Session Flow

#### Step 1: Capture the Big Goal

**Question:** "What's the Big Goal you want to break down? State it as clearly and specifically as possible."

**Validation:** "Does this goal scare you a little? A good Big Goal should stretch you."
- Options: Yes, it's ambitious | No, I should think bigger | Let me revise it

**Clarification (if needed):** "How will you know when you've achieved this goal? What's the specific outcome?"

#### Step 2: Work Backwards to Checkpoints

**Question:** "Imagine it's December 31 and you've achieved this goal. What was true at mid-year that made this possible?"

**Follow-up:** "Now go back further. What needed to be true by the end of Q1?"

**Optional depth:** "Are there specific Q3 milestones, or is it a steady progression from mid-year to year-end?"

#### Step 3: Identify Daily Systems

**Question:** "What's the simplest daily action that creates forward progress toward this goal? Think about something you can do every single day."

**Prompt if stuck:**
- Options: Time-based (X minutes of...) | Action-based (Do X every day) | Quantity-based (X reps/pages/calls) | Other

**Second system (optional):** "Is there a second daily action that would accelerate progress, or is one system enough?"

#### Step 4: Set ABC Levels

For each Daily System:

**Question:** "Let's make this sustainable with ABC levels:
- **A (great day):** If everything's perfect, what's the ambitious version?
- **B (normal day):** What's realistic on a typical day?
- **C (tough day):** What's the absolute minimum to keep the streak alive?"

**Validation:** "Does your C level feel achievable even when sick, traveling, or overwhelmed? If not, make it smaller."

#### Step 5: Define Anti-Goals via Inversion

**Question:** "What would be the worst outcome from pursuing this goal? What would make achieving it feel hollow?"

**Follow-up:** "What specifically do you refuse to sacrifice in pursuit of this goal?"

**Framing options:**
- Health (physical/mental)
- Relationships (family, friends, partner)
- Other priorities (existing commitments)
- Values (integrity, principles)
- Time (specific activities you won't give up)

#### Step 6: Summary

Present the complete decomposition and confirm accuracy.

### Checkpoint Goals (Working Backwards)

| Checkpoint | Target Date | Milestone |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Q1 | March 31 | ________________________________ |
| Mid-Year | June 30 | ________________________________ |
| Q3 | September 30 | ________________________________ |
| Year-End | December 31 | ________________________________ |

### Daily Systems

#### System 1: ________________________________

| Level | Definition | Time/Quantity |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| A | ________________________________ | _________ |
| B | ________________________________ | _________ |
| C | ________________________________ | _________ |

**30-for-30 Start:** If this is a new habit, commit to 30 days at the B level before introducing ABC flexibility.

#### System 2: ________________________________

| Level | Definition | Time/Quantity |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| A | ________________________________ | _________ |
| B | ________________________________ | _________ |
| C | ________________________________ | _________ |

---

#### System 3 (if needed): ________________________________

| Level | Definition | Time/Quantity |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| A | ________________________________ | _________ |
| B | ________________________________ | _________ |
| C | ________________________________ | _________ |

### Anti-Goals (Guardrails)

**The worst outcome would be:** ________________________________

**What I refuse to sacrifice:**

1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________

**Warning signs that I'm violating Anti-Goals:**

- ________________________________
- ________________________________

### Execution Commitments

- [ ] I will start my Daily Systems on: _________ (date)
- [ ] I will use the Two-Day Rule: never skip two days in a row
- [ ] I will check progress at my monthly review
- [ ] I will course-correct if I see Anti-Goal warning signs

## Quick Reference

**The Mountain Metaphor:**
- Big Goal = Summit
- Checkpoints = Campsites
- Daily Systems = Footsteps
- Anti-Goals = What you won't sacrifice on the climb

**Key Principles:**
- Work backwards from the end
- Daily Systems create compounding progress
- ABC levels keep you consistent
- Anti-Goals prevent pyrrhic victories

**Remember:** Ideas are cheap, execution is expensive. The Daily Systems ARE the goal.
