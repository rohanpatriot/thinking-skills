# Goal Decomposition Template

Break down a single Big Goal into actionable Checkpoint Goals, Daily Systems, and Anti-Goals.

---

## When to Use This Template

- You have one specific Big Goal to work through in detail
- You want to reverse-engineer a goal into daily actions
- You're mid-year and adding a new goal to your plan
- You need to rebuild the infrastructure for an existing goal

## Instructions for Claude

When you receive a request to decompose a single goal, guide the user through this focused session using the `AskUserQuestion` tool.

### Session Flow

#### Step 1: Capture the Big Goal

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What's the Big Goal you want to break down? State it as clearly and specifically as possible."
- Options: Let me describe my goal | I need help clarifying it | Show me examples first

**Validation (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Does this goal scare you a little? A good Big Goal should stretch you."
- Options: Yes, it's ambitious | No, I should think bigger | Let me revise it

**Clarification (via AskUserQuestion tool, if needed):**
- Question: "How will you know when you've achieved this goal? What's the specific outcome?"
- Options: I have clear success criteria | Help me define success | I'm not sure yet

#### Step 2: Work Backwards to Checkpoints

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Imagine it's December 31 and you've achieved this goal. What was true at mid-year that made this possible?"
- Options: Let me describe a milestone | Help me identify one | Work backwards together

**Follow-up (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Now go back further. What needed to be true by the end of Q1?"
- Options: I have a Q1 milestone | Help me define one | Skip to daily systems

**Optional depth (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Are there specific Q3 milestones, or is it a steady progression from mid-year to year-end?"
- Options: Add Q3 milestone | Steady progression is fine | Skip to daily systems

#### Step 3: Identify Daily Systems

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What's the simplest daily action that creates forward progress toward this goal? Think about something you can do every single day."
- Options: Time-based (X minutes of...) | Action-based (Do X every day) | Quantity-based (X reps/pages/calls) | Help me identify one

**Second system (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Is there a second daily action that would accelerate progress, or is one system enough?"
- Options: Add a second system | One system is enough | Help me decide

#### Step 4: Set ABC Levels

For each Daily System:

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Let's make this sustainable with ABC levels. What's your A (great day), B (normal day), and C (tough day) version?"
- Options: I'll define all three | Help me calibrate levels | Show me examples first

**Validation (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "Does your C level feel achievable even when sick, traveling, or overwhelmed? If not, make it smaller."
- Options: Yes, C is doable anywhere | No, I need to lower C | Help me recalibrate

#### Step 5: Define Anti-Goals via Inversion

**Ask (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What would be the worst outcome from pursuing this goal? What would make achieving it feel hollow?"
- Options: Health sacrifice | Relationship sacrifice | Values compromise | Time/energy burnout | Let me describe something else

**Follow-up (via AskUserQuestion tool):**
- Question: "What specifically do you refuse to sacrifice in pursuit of this goal?"
- Options: Health (physical/mental) | Relationships (family, friends) | Other priorities | Values (integrity, principles) | Time (specific activities)

#### Step 6: Summary

Present the complete decomposition and confirm accuracy.

## Decomposition Template

### The Big Goal

**Goal:** ________________________________

**Success Criteria:** ________________________________

**Category:** Professional / Personal

**Does it scare you?** Yes / No

### Checkpoint Goals (Working Backwards)

| Checkpoint | Target Date | Milestone |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Q1 | March 31 | ________________________________ |
| Mid-Year | June 30 | ________________________________ |
| Q3 | September 30 | ________________________________ |
| Year-End | December 31 | ________________________________ |

### Daily Systems

#### System 1: ________________________________

| Level | Definition | Time/Quantity |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| A | ________________________________ | _________ |
| B | ________________________________ | _________ |
| C | ________________________________ | _________ |

**30-for-30 Start:** If this is a new habit, commit to 30 days at the B level before introducing ABC flexibility.

#### System 2: ________________________________

| Level | Definition | Time/Quantity |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| A | ________________________________ | _________ |
| B | ________________________________ | _________ |
| C | ________________________________ | _________ |

---

#### System 3 (if needed): ________________________________

| Level | Definition | Time/Quantity |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| A | ________________________________ | _________ |
| B | ________________________________ | _________ |
| C | ________________________________ | _________ |

### Anti-Goals (Guardrails)

**The worst outcome would be:** ________________________________

**What I refuse to sacrifice:**

1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________

**Warning signs that I'm violating Anti-Goals:**

- ________________________________
- ________________________________

### Execution Commitments

- [ ] I will start my Daily Systems on: _________ (date)
- [ ] I will use the Two-Day Rule: never skip two days in a row
- [ ] I will check progress at my monthly review
- [ ] I will course-correct if I see Anti-Goal warning signs

## Quick Reference

**The Mountain Metaphor:**
- Big Goal = Summit
- Checkpoints = Campsites
- Daily Systems = Footsteps
- Anti-Goals = What you won't sacrifice on the climb

**Key Principles:**
- Work backwards from the end
- Daily Systems create compounding progress
- ABC levels keep you consistent
- Anti-Goals prevent pyrrhic victories

**Remember:** Ideas are cheap, execution is expensive. The Daily Systems ARE the goal.
