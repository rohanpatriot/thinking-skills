# Extraction Patterns

How to identify and extract high-value content from books.

## Framework Detection

### Textual Signals

**Explicit naming:**
- "I call this the X"
- "The X Framework/Model/Matrix/Method"
- "What I've termed X"
- Capitalized Multi-Word Phrases

**Structural signals:**
- "There are three/four/five components..."
- "The first step... The second step..."
- "On one axis... on the other axis..."
- "The intersection of X and Y"

**Visual descriptions:**
- "Picture a 2x2 matrix"
- "Imagine a pyramid with..."
- "Think of it as a flywheel"
- "The diagram shows..."

### Extraction Template

```
Framework: {Exact name from book}
Type: {Matrix/Pyramid/Cycle/Hierarchy/Process/Spectrum}
Components: {List the parts}
Key insight: {Why this framing matters}
Application: {How to use it}
Source: {Chapter/page reference}
```

## Principle Detection

### Textual Signals

**Imperative commands:**
- "Always X"
- "Never Y"
- "The rule is..."
- "The key is to..."

**Contrarian positions:**
- "Most people think X, but actually Y"
- "The conventional wisdom is wrong"
- "Counter-intuitively..."

**Repeated themes:**
- Concepts that appear in multiple chapters
- Ideas referenced back throughout
- Summary/conclusion emphasis

### Extraction Template

```
Principle: {Short memorable phrase}
Full statement: {Complete articulation}
Rationale: {Why it's true}
Counter-example: {When it doesn't apply, if mentioned}
```

## Technique Detection

### Textual Signals

**Process indicators:**
- "Here's how to..."
- "The process is..."
- "Step 1... Step 2..."
- "First... Then... Finally..."

**Outcome references:**
- "This will result in..."
- "You'll find that..."
- "The outcome is..."

**Specificity markers:**
- Time durations ("for 25 minutes")
- Quantities ("write three")
- Frequencies ("every morning")

### Extraction Template

```
Technique: {Name or create one}
Purpose: {What it accomplishes}
Steps:
  1. {Action}
  2. {Action}
  3. {Action}
Prerequisites: {What's needed first}
Duration: {How long it takes}
Frequency: {How often to apply}
```

## Anti-Pattern Detection

### Textual Signals

**Warning language:**
- "Don't..."
- "Avoid..."
- "The mistake is..."
- "Warning:"
- "The trap is..."

**Failure stories:**
- "Company X failed because..."
- "I made the mistake of..."
- "The common error is..."

**Contrast patterns:**
- "Instead of X, do Y"
- "Not X but Y"
- "The opposite of what you'd expect"

### Extraction Template

```
Anti-pattern: {Short name}
Description: {What people do wrong}
Why it fails: {The mechanism of failure}
What to do instead: {The correct approach}
Example: {Concrete case if provided}
```

## Voice Calibration

### What to Capture

**Sentence structure:**
- Average sentence length
- Use of fragments
- Rhetorical questions
- Repetition patterns

**Example style:**
- Stories vs data vs analogies
- Personal anecdotes vs case studies
- Named examples vs hypotheticals

**Tone markers:**
- Confidence level (hedging vs assertive)
- Formality (casual vs academic)
- Humor (present vs absent)
- Direct address to reader

**Distinctive phrases:**
- Catchphrases or coined terms
- Recurring metaphors
- Signature openings/closings

### Extraction Template

```
Sentence rhythm: {Short/medium/long, varied or consistent}
Example preference: {Stories/Data/Analogies/Mixed}
Confidence style: {Bold claims/Hedged/Evidence-heavy}
Reader address: {Direct "you"/Inclusive "we"/Third person}
Signature elements: {Unique phrases, metaphors, patterns}
Sample sentences: {3-5 representative examples}
```

## Priority Hierarchy

When a book has abundant content, prioritize extraction in this order:

1. **Frameworks** - Highest leverage, most reusable
2. **Anti-patterns** - Often more valuable than positive advice
3. **Techniques** - Immediately actionable
4. **Principles** - Guiding heuristics
5. **Voice** - For writing/communication skills
6. **Examples** - To ground the frameworks

## Chapter Analysis Workflow

For each chapter:

1. **Skim for structure** - Headers, lists, diagrams
2. **Mark frameworks** - Highlight named models
3. **Note principles** - Imperative statements
4. **Capture techniques** - Step-by-step methods
5. **Flag anti-patterns** - Warnings and failures
6. **Sample voice** - Representative sentences

Then synthesize across chapters:
- Merge related frameworks
- Deduplicate principles
- Order by importance/frequency of reference
