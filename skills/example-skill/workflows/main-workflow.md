## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Context

**What to do:**
Ask clarifying questions to understand:
- What is the current situation?
- What triggered this need?
- Who is affected?

**Example output:**
> "Before I help with [task], let me understand: [specific question]?"

### Step 2: Apply the Framework

**What to do:**
Use the relevant framework from [references/core-concepts.md](../references/core-concepts.md) to analyze the situation.

**Key questions to consider:**
1. Question one?
2. Question two?
3. Question three?

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

**What to do:**
Based on the analysis, provide:
- Specific, actionable recommendations
- Prioritized next steps
- Potential risks or considerations

**Example output:**
```
## Recommendations

1. **First priority**: [Action] because [reason]
2. **Second priority**: [Action] because [reason]
3. **Consider**: [Trade-off or alternative]
```

### Step 4: Validate and Iterate

**What to do:**
- Check if recommendations address the original need
- Ask for feedback
- Refine based on new information

## Example Session

**User:** "I need help with [specific situation]"

**Response:**
1. Ask: "To help effectively, can you tell me [clarifying question]?"
2. Apply framework from core concepts
3. Provide structured recommendations
4. Offer to dive deeper on any area

## Common Variations
